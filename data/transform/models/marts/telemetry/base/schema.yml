models:
  - name: structured_events
    description: This table includes the blended set of structured legacy Google Analytics (GA) and Snowplow data.
      Projects are compared using event counts at the week level, once they have parity for a week we switch to using Snowplow over GA.
      There are data tests that assert that the project and event counts in this table are >= that of just GA.

      - name: event_source

      considered active in terms of Snowplow as its primary source of events.

        tests:
          - not_null
